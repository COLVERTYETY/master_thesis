# Abstract

This thesis explores the potential of AI-driven augmented reality (AR) interfaces to enhance Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by introducing low-signaling, high-possibility affordances that support complex, creative tasks with minimal user input. Key questions addressed include: What challenges are associated with designing low-signaling, high-possibility affordances, and how can AR facilitate intuitive collaboration between users and AI systems? The study implements two main projects, Totem and LLM Whiteboard, which leverage technologies like SDXL Turbo and Langchain to enable dynamic interactions and real-time AI-augmented creation within AR environments. Findings demonstrate that AI-driven AR can significantly expand user capabilities in creative domains by providing intuitive, collaborative interfaces. Totem exemplifies how AI and AR enable dynamic digital art creation through seamless, interactive storytelling, while LLM Whiteboard illustrates the potential for spatially aware, collaborative coding environments that blend physical and digital contexts. This research suggests a new paradigm in HCI, where AI-augmented AR extends cognitive capacities and fosters collaborative creativity, paving the way for immersive, accessible applications in digital art, education, and beyond.
